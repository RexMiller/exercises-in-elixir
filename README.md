# Exercises in Elixir

These are some exercises I've been working on while learning [Elixir](http://elixir-lang.org). Some of them came from the [Getting Started with Elixir](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/elixir-getting-started/) video on Pluralsight. Others came from Dave Thomas's [Programming Elixir](https://pragprog.com/book/elixir13/programming-elixir-1-3) book.

None of the code is copied directly from those sources; it is either my solution to a proposed exercise, an adaptation of a provided solution, or just my noodling around. The purpose of this repository is to help me remember/refer to things I've learned.
